# Travel-Map-System
This is a travel companion application that can be used by end-users to search for resaurants, hotels, and attractions based on their choices of different world locations written. I achieved this application by implementing a user interface using Material-UI to fetch/filter data of local restaurants, hotels, and attractions of a given place by Internet reviews, prices, types, and pictures by connecting to Google Maps API and Rapid API.

Quick notes for setup:
Before you start to run the application:
1. Visit https://nodejs.org/en/ and download the current version node.js on your computer.
2. Run npx-create-react-app ./ on your ide terminal in order to generate a new empty react application inside the folder.
3. Install all the necessary dependencies by simply running npm install @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons @material-ui/lab @react-google-maps/api axios google-map-react.
4. Run npm start to text the code!
5. Don't forget to replace your own unique keys for Maps JavaScript API and places API from Google Maps API and Rapid API.
